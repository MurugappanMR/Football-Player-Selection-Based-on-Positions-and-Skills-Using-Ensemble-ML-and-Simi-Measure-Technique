# Football-Player-Selection-Based-on-Positions-and-Skills-Using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms

Problem Discussed:
In all the previous researches, football players has been selected based on predicting only the 4 major positions like forward, midfielder, defender and goalkeeper and not by considering all the minor positions and other approach of selecting similar players using similarity measures.

Need for this research:
To help the football team selection committee to select the players to a position more precisely by considering all the 27 major and minor positions using ensemble ML approach, which helps in improving the model performance and mainly to avoid selecting the Players only based on their current ratings, market value and second approach is to select similar player using similarity measures.

As a Novel approach to this research, Football players has been selected based on two approaches. 

First approach is predicting the player position to select that player to play for a particular position. This is done in two novel ways

One is traditionally predicting the player positions out of 4 major position like forward, midfielder, defender and goalkeeper using the novel ensemble machine learning models and select that player for that position.

Second is novel approach of predicting the player positions out of 27 different positions including major and minor positions using the novel ensemble machine learning models like svc lrc, rfc and dtc and select that player for that position.

Second approach is selecting the most similar player for replacing a particular player using novel similarity measures like cosine similarity and Euclidean distance and compared these similarity measures techniques.
